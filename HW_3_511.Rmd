## Problem 3.3

Cloud Seeding. Why was it important that the airplane crew was unaware of whether seeding was conducted or not? 

**Answer:** It is important that the pilots were blind to the study to control any other variables. For example, maybe they would fly differently or avoid clouds becuase they knew they were seeding.

## Problem 3.5

Agent Orange. How would you respond to the comment that the box plots in Display 3.3 indicate that the dioxin levels in the Vietnam veterans tend to be larger since their values appear to be larger?

**Answer:** It is clear that the box plots have identical 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values. The outliers will shift the mean, but the median (50th percentile) remains the same. The outliers could be due to the chance of sampling too.

## Problem 3.8

Schizophrenia. In the schizophrenia study in Section 2.1.2, the observations in the two groups (schizophrenic and nonschizophrenic) are not independent since each subject is matched with a twin in the other group. Did the researchers make a mistake? 

**Answer:** With twins, it can be a little bit tricky. Since their DNA is _identical_ the data is technically paired.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
