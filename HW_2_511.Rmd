## Problem 2.3

For comparing two population means when the population distributions have the same standard deviation, the standard deviation is sometimes referred to as a nuisance parameter. Explain why it might be considered a nuisance.

**Answer:** When the standard deviations are the same, the mean should be used to compare the distributions of the two populations. 

## Problem 2.6

What is wrong with the hypothesis that Y 2 - Y 1 is 0?

**Answer:** This would infer that there is no difference in the population means. Y(bar) refers to an unkown perameter.

## Problem 2.7

What can be said from this statement about a p-value for the hypothesis that the mean difference is zero? 

**Answer:** The mean of 0 is not within the confidence interval. Therefore the p value must be less than 0.05

## Problem 2.13

(a) Compute the averages and the sample standard deviations for each group separately. 

```{r my_data_13}

my_data_13 %>%
  group_by(Diet) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(BP), sd = sd(BP))
```
(b) Compute the pooled estimate of standard deviation using the formula in Section 2.3.2. 

```{r my_data_13}
# There are two methods to find it. Use a function or write out the equation.
pooled.sd(my_data_13)
# This is the second, slightly more complicated way.
n1 <- 7
n2 <- 7
s1 <- sd(my_data_13$BP[my_data_13$Diet == "FishOil"]) 
s2 <- sd(my_data_13$BP[my_data_13$Diet == "RegularOil"]) # why is this wrong?

Sp <- sqrt(((n1-1)*s1^2+(n2-1)*s2^2)/(n1+n2-2))
```

(c) Compute SE.Y 2 ! Y 1/ using the formula in Section 2.3.2. 

(d) What are the degrees of freedom associated with the pooled estimate of standard deviation? What is the 97.5th percentile of the t-distribution with this many degrees of freedom? 

(e) Construct a 95% conﬁdence interval for !2 ! !1 using the formula in Section 2.3.3. 

(f) Compute the t-statistic for testing equality as shown in Section 2.3.5. 

(g) Find the one-sided p-value (as evidence that the ﬁsh oil diet resulted in greater reduction of blood pressure) by comparing the t-statistic in (f) to the percentiles of the appropriate t-distribution (by reading the appropriate percentile from a computer program or calculator).

## Problem 2.22

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
